I would Ideally like to make RunIt cross platform:

The main (perhaps only) thing making RunIt platform specific is it's use of MS Windows APIs (in ShellExecute)

To make RunIt cross platform, that would need to change.

The following question(s) need to be answered:

1) Boost has a platform independent "Shell execute" or "CreateProcess" process; What of C++17, would that include that now?
