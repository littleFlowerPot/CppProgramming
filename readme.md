# CppProgramming

This repo contains all my C++ concept and topic explorations and explanations of why things work in the language, on my journey with learning, using, and constructing software with the language.

As a rule this repository does not have products/projects, but rather single exploration units, protypes, and playing with concepts before implementing them into production code. There are a couple of projects however.

More specifically (although not exhaustive - I list out what I think are some cleaner folders, but the ones not listed can also be of interest)
